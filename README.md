# Array_MIPS
This MIPS assembly code is designed to perform operations based on user input, focusing on either integer arrays or strings (alphabetic input). Here's a brief overview:
The code begins by prompting the user to specify the type of input they want to provide: 1 for integers or 0 for alphabetic strings. Based on this input, it either proceeds to handle integer operations or string operations.
# For integer input:
It initializes an array based on user input.
It allows the user to choose an operation: printing the array, calculating the average of the array elements, or finding the maximum value in the array.
# For string input:
It prompts the user to enter a string and choose an operation: checking if the string is a palindrome, comparing it with another string, or displaying some information.
Overall, the program demonstrates basic functionality to handle different types of input (integer arrays and strings), perform various operations based on user choice, and display appropriate results.
